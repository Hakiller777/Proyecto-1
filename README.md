# Django Login System with PostgreSQL

A basic but functional user authentication system built using **Django**, integrated with **PostgreSQL**. This project implements a login, registration, and logout system using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication features, custom user forms, and static frontend templates styled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> âœ… The system currently supports full user registration and login functionality. All connections to the database are working, and the project is fully ready for extension or deployment.
